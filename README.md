In the current ‘Data’ world, prediction is all based on the analysis of data available and collected. Taxi company’s like Uber & Lyft, heavily depend on the data which is generated by their drivers to provide reliable service. Starting with general data like Pickup and destination is collected when the ride is booked and the demand is calculated based on the patterns (day, time, events..). 
Taxi drivers generate data even when they are not carrying any passengers like inferences on traffic patterns. Data Science helps in prediction of supply and demand algorithm analysis, surge pricing, better cars, estimating fares, driver ratings and importantly for autonomous car research, tracking the location of drivers, monitoring driver’s speed, motion and acceleration and identifying if a driver is working for a competing cab sharing company.
